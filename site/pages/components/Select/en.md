| format | string \| function | d => d | Format value<br />Default value, return original data. <br />When it is a string, it will get the value from the original data as a key .The same as (d) => d[format]<br /> When it is a function, the result returned by the function will be the value. |
| name | string | none | The name of a Form that accesses data |
| keygen | string \| function(obj):string | index | Generate a auxiliary method for each key<br />If not filled, index will be used(not recommended,there may be problems with more than 10 data)<br />When it is a function, use its return value.<br />When it is a stringï¼Œues the value of the string.For example, 'id' is the same thing as (d) => d.id. |
